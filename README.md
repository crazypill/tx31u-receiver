# tx31u-receiver

This is firmware for the Adafruit Feather RFM69 (M0) board.  It is designed to pick up weather sensor radio signals from a WS-1516 compatible system, specifically the TX31U+ transmitter by LaCrosse (which is probably long obsolete but mine still works, so there).

This code was made possible by this previous work that I found here: http://www.g-romahn.de/ws1600/Datepakete_raw.txt

There's a bunch of open-source code inside here and there that I haven't had a chance to attribute yet, please forgive me.
